/**
 * Sends a list of encoded spans to a transport such as HTTP or Kafka. Usually, this involves
 * encoding them into a message and enqueueing them for transport in a corresponding client library.
 * The typical end recipient is a zipkin collector.
 *
 * <p>Unless mentioned otherwise, senders are not thread-safe. They were designed to be used by a
 * single reporting thread, hence the operation is blocking
 *
 * <p>Those looking to initialize eagerly can {@link #send(List)} with an empty list. This can be
 * used to reduce latency on the first send operation, or to fail fast.
 *
 * <p><em>Implementation notes</em>
 *
 * <p>The parameter is a list of encoded spans as opposed to an encoded message. This allows
 * implementations flexibility on how to encode spans into a message. For example, a large span
 * might need to be sent as a separate message to avoid kafka limits. Also, logging transports like
 * scribe will likely write each span as a separate log line.
 *
 * <p>This accepts a list of {@link BytesEncoder#encode(Object) encoded spans}, as opposed a list of
 * spans like {@code zipkin2.Span}. This allows senders to be re-usable as model shapes change. This
 * also allows them to use their most natural message type. For example, kafka would more naturally
 * send messages as byte arrays.
